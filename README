NAME
    Sys::Sendfile::OSX - Exposing sendfile() for OS X

SYNOPSIS
     use Sys::Sendfile::OSX qw(sendfile);

     open my $local_fh, '<', 'somefile';
     my $socket_fh = IO::Socket::INET->new(
       PeerHost => "10.0.0.1",
       PeerPort => "8080"
     );

     my $rv = sendfile($local_fh, $socket_fh);

DESCRIPTION
    The sendfile() function is a zero-copy function for transferring the
    contents of a filehandle to a streaming socket.

    As per the man pages, the sendfile() function was made available as of
    Mac OS X 10.5.

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
    sendfile($from, $to[, $count])
        Pipes the contents of the filehandle `$from' into the socket stream
        `$to'.

        Optionally, it will make multiple sendfile() calls to do it, piping
        across `$count' bytes at a time. Otherwise it will attempt to send
        the entire contents of the filehandle in one call.

        The filehandles can be globs or they can be IO::Handle-like objects
        (or anything that has a `fileno' method).

    syssendfile($from, $to, $count, $offset)
        A direct one-to-one call into the sendfile() syscall. See the man
        pages for usage information.
